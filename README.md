# react-course
This is my follow-up works and notes for the Udemy react course taught by Brad Schiff.
## How to use it?
You could actually use this repo directly in your local development.<br>
Firstly, create your own .env file following my DOTENV file's instructions.<br>
git clone this repo:<br>
Open two terminals at the root of this repo: <br>
Run<br>
```
cd *api
npm run start #to support your backend
```
And also on another terminal:
```
cd *app
npm run dev #to support your frontend
```
Then, you could visit your deployment on ```localhost:3000```
I personally deploy my backend on heroku, and my frontend on netlify on Internet.<br>
