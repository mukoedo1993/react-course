Notes for the course:
[react for the rest of us, udemy for course 2nd to 10th](https://www.udemy.com/share/102WQm3@x9BWMuSen5qCx3DvbfRWrx6E2gtaE3YWx5LM2GkEamWH-aMMqT8VHdEnB135C7gQ/)


# How to use it?
You could actually use this repo directly in your local development.<br>
Firstly, create your own .env file following my DOTENV file's instructions.<br>
git clone this repo:<br>
Open two terminals at the root of this repo: <br>
Run<br>
```
cd *api
npm run start #to support your backend
```
And also on another terminal:
```
cd *app
npm run dev #to support your frontend
```
<br>
Then, you could visit your deployment on `localhost:3000`    
I personally deploy my backend on heroku, and my frontend on netlify on Internet.<br>
