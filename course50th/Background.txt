You cannot exactly transiting an element with access or styling if it's not already in the DOM to begin with.
Also, when it comes to slowly or gradually animating it out of you when you want to close it.
But, the ms we click this, it is completely removed from the DOM. So, again, you can't transition an element that doesn't even exist any longer.
