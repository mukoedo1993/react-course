Note About a Common Misspelling
Hello everyone,

In the following lecture we setup an environment variable named `JWTSECRET`. I'm creating this article as a quick public service announcement to let you know that `JWTSECRET` is very easy to type incorrectly. Many students were having various issues throughout the course, and it all stemmed from misspelling `JWTSECRET` in the following lecture; once they fixed that their issues were resolved. So this is just a friendly notice to double or even triple check that your spelling matches what you see in the video lesson.

Cheers, and I hope you enjoy learning React!
Brad
