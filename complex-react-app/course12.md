Quick VS Code Settings
Hello everyone,

Within your `settings.json` file (that stores your VS Code configuration) from the previous lesson you may also want to include these two options as well:

```
"prettier.arrowParens": "avoid",
"prettier.trailingComma": "none"
```

The first option will allow you to write an arrow function and if you have exactly one parameter you can skip the parentheses without Prettier adding them in for you (which can be annoying). The second option makes sure you don't have unnecessary commas after the final property when defining an object literal. Neither of these settings are necessary, but I do use them in my personal VS Code setup.

Thanks, now let's keep learning about React!
