a component might add keyboard bindings so to listen for a certain key to be pressed, 
or, perhaps a full screen search overlay you want to bind an action to when a user press the space key to close
that user model. But once this component is no longer rendered, you want to remove the keyboard listener.  
Essentially, the cleanup function is just a chance you pick up after yourself[1], after the component is no longer being used.
