Regarding The Index In The Next Lesson<br>
Hello everyone,<br>

In the next video at around the 14 to 15 minute mark we go into MongoDB Atlas to create an index for our Posts collection.
<br>You do not need to create an index if you downloaded the `backend-api` files for our project after March 15th 2021.
<br>Essentially, this morning I added a line to the [models/Post.js](https://github.com/LearnWebCode/react-course/blob/master/backend-api/models/Post.js#L7) file in our backend that will create the index for us automatically.
<br>
Thanks!
Brad
